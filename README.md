This repository is for deterministic build results for Mogwaicoin releases.

See the [release process](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/master/doc/release-process.md)
in the Mogwaicoin repository for how to
deterministically build binaries and then pgp-sign them.

[Instructions for setting up a virtual machine](https://github.com/mogwaicoin/mogwai/blob/master/doc/gitian-building.md) in which you can
gitian build can also be found there.
